\section{Assignment 4: LaTex Mathemaical Notations}
\textbf{By:} Jayshri Saha.


\subsection{Task Overview}

In our recent LaTeX class, we were assigned a task to create a LaTeX document replicating a given attachment and format it according to specific guidelines. The document had to be named as per the following structure:\\ \texttt{Rollno\_DeptName\_Firstname.tex}.\\ 
Additionally, we were required to compile and generate a PDF from the LaTeX source file, include an image file (.png or .jpg), and submit the files in a ZIP archive.

\subsection{Task Instructions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Write a LaTeX document that replicates the format and structure of a provided attachment.
    \item Name the LaTeX file in the format: \texttt{Rollno\_DeptName\_Firstname.tex}.
    \item Compile the LaTeX file to generate a PDF output.
    \item Include an image in the document, either a .png or .jpg.
    \item Submit the following files:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item LaTeX source code (.tex)
        \item Output document (.pdf)
        \item Image file (.png or .jpg)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Zip the files together into a single archive named as \texttt{Rollno\_DeptName\_Firstname.zip}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Writing the LaTeX Source Code}

Using the LaTeX editor, we wrote the document according to the instructions. The task required careful attention to detail to ensure that the layout, text, and structure matched the provided attachment. We also ensured that the formatting adhered to LaTeX best practices, such as using sections, subsections, and appropriate font sizes.

\subsection{Adding an Image}

We included an image file in the LaTeX document using the \texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics} command. The image was placed at the appropriate location in the document, ensuring that it fit well with the text layout and did not disrupt the flow of the document.

\subsection{Compiling to PDF}

After completing the LaTeX code, We compiled the document into a PDF using a LaTeX compiler. This process generated the desired output, replicating the original attachment.



\subsection{Final Submission}

After verifying that all files were correct and the document rendered as intended, we created a ZIP archive with the name \texttt{Rollno\_DeptName\_Firstname.zip}. The ZIP file contained the LaTeX source code, PDF output, and the imageÂ file.

\section{Git Branching Merging and Conflict Resolution}
\textbf{By:} Harsh Vardhan Pandey.

\subsection{Objective}
The objective of this assignment was to demonstrate proficiency in Git branching, merging, and conflict resolution by working through a series of steps involving branch creation, modification of shared files, and the resolution of conflicts that arise from merging.


\subsection{ Creating a New Repository}
We started by creating a new repository on GitHub named \texttt{git-advanced}. We cloned this repository to our local machine.

\subsection{ Creating and Working on Branches}
Next, we created a new branch called \texttt{feature-1} and switched to it. After switching to \texttt{feature-1}, we created a file named \texttt{shared.txt} and added the following content:
\begin{verbatim}
This is a shared file.
Line 1: Original text.
Line 2: Original text.
\end{verbatim}
We staged and committed the changes and then pushed the branch to GitHub.

\subsection{Creating a Second Branch from feature-1}
Following this, we created another branch called \texttt{feature-2} and switched to it. In this branch, we modified the second line of \texttt{shared.txt} to.Modifying the second line of feature-2:
\begin{verbatim}
Line 2: Modified text in feature-2.
\end{verbatim}
We staged and committed the changes and then pushed the \texttt{feature-2} branch to GitHub.

\subsection{Modifying the File in Feature-1 Branch}
We switched back to \texttt{feature-1} and then modified the second line of \texttt{shared.txt} to:
\begin{verbatim}
Line 2: Modified text in feature-1.
\end{verbatim}
We staged and committed the changes and pushed this branch to GitHub.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
\end{center}

\subsection{Merging Feature-1 into Main}
After ensuring the changes in \texttt{feature-1} were pushed, we switched to the \texttt{main} branch and merged \texttt{feature-1} into it and pushed the updated \texttt{main} branch.

    \textwidth]{image2.png} 
    \vspace{0.5cm}
\end{center}
\subsection{Merging Feature-2 and Resolving Conflict}
Next, we attempted to merge \texttt{feature-2} into the \texttt{main} branch. This resulted in a merge conflict in \texttt{shared.txt} because both branches modified the second line. Git identified the conflict and marked it as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
<<<<<<< HEAD
Line 2: Modified text in feature-1.
=======
Line 2: Modified text in feature-2.
>>>>>>> feature-2
\end{verbatim}
We resolved the conflict by editing the file to the following content:
\begin{verbatim}
Line 2: Merged text from both branches.
\end{verbatim}
We then staged and committed the conflict resolution. Finally, we pushed the changes to GitHub.\\

\end{center}

\subsection*{7. Deleting Branches}
After the merge and conflict resolution, we deleted both feature branches locally and remotely.
